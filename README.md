# McCallASTR104PS4
My code for question 1 and 2 of PS4 for ASTR 104, F25

h_tab_i.dat was given to us, but I also added it here since it is essential for my code to run.

Questions 1 and 2 are both fully solved within the jupyter notebook. Important answers / statements are printed at the bottom of certain cells, and all cells are labelled with the portion of whatever problem they are solving.
